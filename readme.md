PROJECT BRIEF

Do you want to put an end to feeling worried about climate change, but you don’t want to sacrifice your life too much?

Smeco might be designed for you – an educational app that welcomes you to multiple choice quiz. In this quiz you fill out your everyday life, from what transport you use the most to how much you spend on electronics, etc… 
After you have finalised your results, we compare you to one of twenty-five countries carbon footprint. Are you comparable to the USA or France?

You’ll be given a rating out of 5, which will moderately point you to were you’re at and if you need to maybe slightly make some adjustments. 

If you’re happy with your result, then you can post it to our Leaderboard. You’ll be ranked alongside other users. 

It doesn’t stop there – 

Select our “Your Tips” page! Here, users can post their own tips and categorise it too (if they wanted to specify if their advice is Household or Lifestyle). If they’re not happy with their advice, they can remove it.

CHARACTER BIOS 


Kris Carter 

Demographics & Characteristics

-	27
-	Works in retail part time so it can coincide with his screenplay that he’s been writing for years. He talks more about it than producing substance. He never went to university as he failed, the course that he needed, English.
-	Lives in Dennistoun with his best mate and his girlfriend. 
-	He’s tall. Built like a bear but he’s a friendly giant. 
-	Spends too much of his time watching tv, playing video games and reading scary climate change articles.

Values & behaviours 
-	Values the planet. 
-	He believes he needs to do everything he can for the environment as if he is Superman.
-	He’ll always recycle. Even if that leads him to holding his recyclable rubbish walking home, passing by loads of general bins. And some cases picking up other peoples litter.

Needs & Goals 

-	Finish his script. Become the next Quentin Tarantino
-	Save the world.

Pain points

-	He has eco-anxiety. 
-	He is very anxious about the world ending, especially before he becomes the next “Quentin Tarantino”.
-	He is triggered about everything to do with the climate change and effects of waste on biodiversity and this results in confrontations with his flatmates and family.

What I’ve learned about Kris?

He’s gullible and naïve. And wants to be insured there’s hope. 

For the website?

I feel it should be hopeful and informative. Easy to use and intellectual with understandable terminology.
