## Brief

The specification outlined by a lifestyle consultancy dealing with environmental sustainability was to build a personal CO2 footprint checker application that calculates a user's CO2 footprint based on their lifestyle via a fun quiz. The application was built using Javascript and the REACT framework with a MongoDB non-relational API database. The final product expands on the client MVP by including a community board where users can add and delete messages. Tables can also be filtered to user preference. The product was presented successfully and praised by the client.

## User Personas

### Kris Carter

#### Demographics & Characteristics

- 27
- Works in retail part time so it can coincide with his screenplay that he’s been writing for years. He talks more about it than producing substance. He never went to university as he failed, the course that he needed, English.
- Lives in Dennistoun with his best mate and his girlfriend.
- He’s tall. Built like a bear but he’s a friendly giant.
- Spends too much of his time watching tv, playing video games and reading scary climate change articles.

#### Values & behaviours

- Values the planet.
- He believes he needs to do everything he can for the environment as if he is Superman.
- He’ll always recycle. Even if that leads him to holding his recyclable rubbish walking home, passing by loads of general bins. And some cases picking up other peoples litter.

#### Needs & Goals

- Finish his script. Become the next Quentin Tarantino
- Save the world.

#### Pain points

- He has eco-anxiety.
- He is very anxious about the world ending, especially before he becomes the next “Quentin Tarantino”.
- He is triggered about everything to do with the climate change and effects of waste on biodiversity and this results in confrontations with his flatmates and family.

#### For the website?

I feel it should be hopeful and informative. Easy to use and intellectual with understandable terminology.

#### Needs & Goals
